This is a dark on light Emacs theme based on
https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs[Bozhidar Batsov's Zenburn theme].

Chris Done created https://github.com/chrisdone/zenburn[the original theme].
This is an updated version for modern Emacsen.

== Setup

The theme is available on MELPA. You can easily install and configure it with
https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package[use-package]:

[source,emacs-lisp]
----
(use-package doneburn-theme
  :ensure t
  :config (load-theme 'doneburn 'no-confirm))
----

== Notes

This theme lacks support for popular packages (e.g. Helm) simply because I just
added the faces for the packages I use.

I just wanted to make Chris Done's original theme easily available to and
modifiable by everyone.

PRs are more than welcome.
